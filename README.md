# Civic Link
A website aimed to let city engineers post construction updates about their community.

# HOSTING LOGIN BACKEND SERVER ON NODE.JS:
The login backend is hosted on node.js locally, meaning if you do not host the server on your computer the login will not work.
If you try logging in without hosting, it will say "server error".

Hosting login backend:
1) download node.js 
2) in vscode terminal, type in: "cd C:\Users\matth\Civic-Link\backendLogin"
3) type "node server.js"
4) if it says: "âœ… Server running on http://localhost:5000", then the server is hosted and logins should work locally.
5) to turn off server: "ctrl+C" in terminal
